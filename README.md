## 🏁 CURRENT RACE LINE (Security Path)

I am currently navigating the **TryHackMe Offensive Pentesting** circuit. My goal is to master the "Over-take" (Exploitation) without losing the "Rear-end" (System Stability).

- 🟢 **Sector 1 (Recon):** Mastering Nmap and advanced enumeration.
- 🟡 **Sector 2 (Exploit):** Web App testing and SQL injection maneuvers.
- 🔴 **Sector 3 (Post):** Privilege escalation and lateral movement.
